# Real-Fake_News_Proj

We are mainly interested in finding out how well modern NLP models can distinguish between real and fake articles. Defining what is fake or real news can be tricky however, and we expect that our data will reflect this. Therefore, we are also interested in finding various characteristics in our fake and real articles that might lead to overfitting.


### Project Overview
This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing news articles. It involves using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify news articles into categories such as real and fake news.

### Dataset
The dataset comprises two CSV files: `True.csv` and `Fake.csv`. Each file contains four columns: `title`, `text`, `subject`, and `date`. The `title` and `text` columns contain the content to be analyzed, while `subject` and `date` provide additional contextual information.

### Libraries and Tools
- **Libraries:**
    - `numpy`
    - `pandas`
    - `re`
    - `nltk`
    - Deep learning frameworks (like TensorFlow or PyTorch) will be used for model implementation.

### Steps Involved
1. **Data Loading:**
    - Load the CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
    - Perform initial data exploration to understand the structure and content of the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Text cleaning:
        - Removing special characters, extra whitespaces, etc.
        - Tokenization and lowercasing.
        - Handling missing values.
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        - Analyze text length, word frequency, and other relevant patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
    - Extracting features from text data.
    - Utilizing NLP techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), or pre-trained language models (BERT, GPT).

4. **Model Building:**
    - Implement deep learning models for classification:
        - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs).
        - Transformer-based architectures (BERT, GPT).
    - Model training, validation, and fine-tuning.
    
5. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
    - Validate model performance through cross-validation or train-test splits.

6. **Inference and Deployment:**
    - Make predictions on new or unseen data.
    - Explore deployment options for the trained model.

### Code Structure
- **Main Script:**
    - `main.py` containing the main workflow of the project.

- **Modules:**
    - `data_preprocessing.py`: Contains functions for data cleaning and feature engineering.
    - `model_building.py`: Holds code for creating, training, and evaluating the deep learning models.

### Usage
1. **Environment Setup:**
    - Install required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.
    - Ensure a suitable Python environment (virtual environment or container) for reproducibility.

2. **Running the Project:**
    - Execute the `main.py` script to run the entire workflow.

### Future Improvements
- Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Explore ensemble methods or transfer learning for enhanced accuracy.
