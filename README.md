## Introduction

This notebook aims to address the challenge of distinguishing between real and fake news articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset used in this analysis contains a collection of textual data, predominantly tweets, concerning COVID-19 information, each labeled as either real or fake. The primary goal is to develop and deploy a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying these articles to combat the spread of misinformation.

# Real-Fake_News_Proj

We are mainly interested in finding out how well modern NLP models can distinguish between real and fake articles. Defining what is fake or real news can be tricky however, and we expect that our data will reflect this. Therefore, we are also interested in finding various characteristics in our fake and real articles that might lead to overfitting.


### Project Overview
This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to analyze a dataset containing news articles. It involves using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify news articles into categories such as real and fake news.

### Dataset
The dataset comprises a collection of approximately 2,140 articles or tweets. Each entry includes the text content and a label indicating whether the article is real or fake. Real articles aim to present accurate information regarding the pandemic, while fake ones disseminate misinformation or misleading content. The textual data involves a wide range of information, opinions, and reports on COVID-19, covering various angles and sources.The dataset comprises two CSV files: `True.csv` and `Fake.csv`. Each file contains four columns: `title`, `text`, `subject`, and `date`. The `title` and `text` columns contain the content to be analyzed, while `subject` and `date` provide additional contextual information.

### Objective

The key objective of this notebook is to implement various machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) methods to classify the articles as either real or fake. The process involves extensive text preprocessing, feature engineering, and the development of classification models to achieve accurate categorization. Throughout this analysis, the aim is not only to achieve high classification accuracy but also to ensure robustness against misinformation and false reports.

### Approach

The notebook covers various stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing text data, handling missing values, and preparing the data for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the dataset, understanding text distributions, and identifying patterns or trends.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating additional features or leveraging external knowledge to improve model performance.
4. **Model Development:** Utilizing various machine learning models like logistic regression, word embeddings (Word2Vec), and deep learning models to classify real and fake articles.
5. **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessing the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and visualizing performance through confusion matrices and ROC curves.

### Accuracy
- **What it Represents:** Accuracy measures the percentage of correctly predicted outcomes (both true positives and true negatives) out of the total outcomes.
- **Your Accuracy Score:** Achieved an accuracy of approximately 73.13%.
- **Interpretation:** This means that the model correctly classified around 73.13% of the articles as either real or fake based on the provided dataset.

### Precision
- **What it Represents:** Precision reflects the model's ability to correctly identify the real articles out of the total articles predicted as real.
- **Your Precision Score:** Obtained a precision of 0.74.
- **Interpretation:** Out of all the articles the model classified as real, approximately 74% were actually real, indicating a relatively good true-positive rate.

### Recall (Sensitivity)
- **What it Represents:** Recall shows the model's ability to correctly detect real articles out of all the actual real articles.
- **Your Recall Score:** Achieved a recall of 0.78.
- **Interpretation:** The model correctly identified around 78% of the actual real articles, indicating a relatively low false negative rate.

### F1 Score
- **What it Represents:** F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balanced evaluation by considering both false positives and false negatives.
- **Your F1 Score:** Obtained an F1 score of approximately 0.76.
- **Interpretation:** This value suggests the model's overall accuracy in classifying real and fake articles, providing a good balance between precision and recall.

### Confusion Matrix
- **What it Represents:** A matrix showing the model's classification performance.
- **Your Confusion Matrix:** It details the numbers of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative classifications.
- **Interpretation:** This matrix offers a deeper understanding of model performance, illustrating where the model excels and any areas requiring improvement.


  BERT's bidirectional design enables a deeper understanding of language. This model comprehends word meaning based on its entire context within a sentence, which is beneficial for nuanced language understanding tasks.
